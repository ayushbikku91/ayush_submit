To deploy a stateless application containerized in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster using Terraform and address the points you've mentioned, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Set Up Your Environment:
   - Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine.
   - Authenticate to your Google Cloud project using the `gcloud` command-line tool.
   - Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration files.

2. Define Your Terraform Configuration:
   - Create a main.tf file to define your Terraform configuration. This file will contain your infrastructure as code.
   
3. Create a GKE Cluster:
   - Use the `google_container_cluster` resource in your Terraform configuration to define your GKE cluster, ensuring high availability and specifying the version you want.

4. Create a Load Balancer:
   - Use the `google_container_cluster` resource to define a GKE cluster. Set the `enable_http_load_balancing` attribute to true. This will create an internal HTTP(S) load balancer for your application.

5. Secure the Network:
   - Use the `google_compute_firewall` resource to define firewall rules to secure your GKE cluster and VMs if applicable. Allow only the necessary traffic.

6. Create a VM if Necessary:
   - If your application requires VMs in addition to GKE, use the `google_compute_instance` resource to define your VM instance. Configure SSH access with your SSH key, and secure it using firewall rules.

7. Service Accounts:
   - Use Google Cloud service accounts for access control. Define service accounts and associate them with the appropriate resources as needed.

8. Securing Access to the Web Application:
   - Depending on your application, implement security measures at the application level. Use Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to manage access to your containers.

9. Network Configuration:
   - Use the `google_compute_network` and `google_compute_subnetwork` resources to create the necessary networks and subnetworks. Ensure that your GKE cluster and VMs are placed within the appropriate subnetworks to control access.

10. Deploy the Application:
   - Use the `google_container_cluster` and `kubernetes` Terraform providers to define your Kubernetes deployment and service resources. Deploy your application containers to the GKE cluster.

11. Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`:
   - Initialize Terraform, review the execution plan, and apply the configuration to create your infrastructure.

12. Testing and Monitoring:
   - After deployment, thoroughly test your setup to ensure it meets the high availability and security requirements.

13. Managing Updates and Maintenance:
   - Set up procedures for updating and maintaining your infrastructure and application.

Please note that creating a full Terraform configuration for this scenario can be quite complex and may require different configurations based on specific application and security requirements. we will need to create separate Terraform files for each resource (e.g., one for GKE, one for firewall rules, etc.) and use module structures for better organization.

Remember to maintain good security practices and adhere to Google Cloud's recommended best practices for security and networking. Regularly review and update your configuration to stay up to date with best practices and security patche
